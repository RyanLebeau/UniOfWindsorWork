/*
 receive input from user for variable 'a'
 set a threshold for square root consecutive guesses in 't'
 set a guess variable starting at 2 as 'g'
 create while loop with constraint (g-((g+a/g)/2)) <= t)
 	divide 'a' by the current guess and set as new value as 'a'
 print 'g' as the square root of 'a'
