	  <!-- content paragraph with first line indentation of 20pixels-->
      <p style="text-indent: 20px">
	  My name is Ryan Lebeau and I am a fourth year Honours Computer Science student. This webpage<br>
	  will be about my day to day schedule and life since it can get pretty hectic. The average week starts<br>
	  with an 8hour work day Monday at Chrysler (usually day shift). Then I try to do 2-3hours of work on<br>
	  an Ignite project I have with Dr.Marquardt when I get home. The project is a Machine Learning model<br>
	  around the seperations of proteins within LDL (a common measurement for heart attack prevention). On<br>
	  Tuesday I have AI Concepts class and then my TA office hours for COMP-1400, which nobody ever goes to so it<br> 
	  gives me a chance to work on this class. Class begins at 10am Wednesday for Principle of Programming<br>
	  Languages and then I am the Lab Instructor for a COMP-1400 lab. Thursday I have to work an afternoon shift<br>
	  at Chrysler so I usually do as much school work as I can beforehand. Then, on Friday, I work days so<br>
	  once I get home I finish up the 5hour week requirement for my Ignite project or any outstanding school<br>
	  work I haven't completed. The weekend is a little bit more relaxed, with only one shift at Chrysler on saturday<br>
	  and Sunday is a catch up day on school while watching the Lion's lose.
