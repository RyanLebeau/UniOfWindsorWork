				&emsp;Hello, my name is Ryan Lebeau and I am a fourth year Computer Science 
				student at the University of Windsor. Although I am a student, I have 
				had experience with many jobs in my past which I will cover in this 
				paragraph (so skip this if you'd like to keep your sanity). When I was 
				17 years old I got my first job at Precision Stamping plant B, cold 
				stamping steel with large mechanical and hydraulic presses. The 
				job was very boring but hired me no problem since my friend was 
				already working there. I was there for about 2 years part time until 
				they laid off a large portion of their employees. Then, as an 
				unemployed student, I decided to apply for a TA position for Systems 
				Programming and got the job working under Dr.Boufama. After that 
				position ended and summer came around, I worked full time at two 
				different factories: AP Plasman and Vistaprint. AP Plasman was a 
				plastic mould injection factory where I was a general labourer, and 
				then at Vistaprint I was a Logistics Material Handler which sounds 
				fancy but, honestly, was very simple. After that summer, I worked 
				mainly as a Website Coordinator for the CUCSC (Canadian Undergraduate 
				Computer Science Conference) for the following two semesters which 
				was an absolute blast and paid off great (the conference was a smash 
				hit at the University). Following that, I briefly worked part-time 
				at Walmart as a fulfillment associate while between jobs. Currently, 
				I am a TA for COMP1400, an RA with Dr.Marquardt on an ML project, and 
				work as a TPT for Chrysler Canada.

				&emsp;Another important topic to me, besides working, is my family. My 
				family consists of my mother (Tania), my father (Marcel), my 
				sister (Christine), and my brother-in law (Derek). We are all 
				very French Canadian about as far back as I can go 
				lineage-wise. Most of my extended family live out of town 
				in Northern Ontario and as far north as the North West 
				Territories. My sister and her husband moved to the Waterloo 
				region about six years ago now, and they just recently purchased 
				they're very own house! Also, since I have already talked 
				about my own work history so much I might as well mention their 
				occupations. My dad is a mechanic by trade, my mom is an insurance 
				broker, and my sister is child care provider.
			</li>
			<li class="last" id="thirdP">
				&emsp;The third thing I'd like to talk about in my bio is my girlfriend, 
				Kate. Since there is not much else to me but I still need 
				another paragraph, this is the perfect topic. Kate is a fourth 
				year Neuroscience student at the University of Windsor who will 
				be pursuing a masters and then a doctorate in Clinical Child 
				NeuroPsychology. We first met through her cousin who been one 
				of my friends for a long time. A bunch of my buddies and I 
				crashed one of their families parties (accidentally) and I ended 
				up spending the entire night with her. After that we didn't 
				talk until months later, on New Years, when she messaged me out 
				of the blue to say hi. We have been together ever since, for 
				about two years now.
